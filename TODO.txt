Bonus 6

Feature:
Bonus 5 completed - NPC AI: The AI acts based on the dealer’s first (and visible) card, defining a level of threat according to the card’s score. Then, it analyzes its own score in each round and calculates the probability of busting. Based on this, it generates a fear level, taking into account its intelligence and the previously calculated values.
It decides whether to hit based on the fear level and a random value representing courage. If the courage is greater than the fear, then it hits. The AI also checks if the score is already 21.
